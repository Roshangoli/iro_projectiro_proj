Project Report: Information Retrieval System

Abstract:-
The project's goal was to create an advanced information retrieval system that could analyze, index, and download online content quickly and effectively. The main goals were to build a responsive query processing unit that could handle user queries in real-time with high relevance and accuracy, and to improve search accuracy using a complex indexing method. Upcoming tasks include expanding the system's capacity to manage increasingly substantial datasets and including sophisticated natural language processing functionalities to enhance the precision and context of searches.

Overview:-
The three primary parts of the system are an indexer based on Scikit-Learn, a query processor based on Flask, and a web crawler based on Scrapy. Utilizing cutting-edge methods for text indexing and web crawling, the solution provides a strong foundation for information retrieval based on the most recent advancements in data science and machine learning.

 Design:-
The system is built to use a crawler to get online pages, use TF-IDF weighting to index material, and prioritize delivering the most relevant results when processing queries. Flask facilitates integration with other databases and APIs, offering a smooth interface for data exchange.

Architecture:-
- Web Crawler: Makes use of Scrapy, with options to set page count and depth limitations.
- Indexer: Based on Scikit-Learn, it supports optional vector embeddings and indexes documents using TF-IDF.
- Query Processor: Built using Flask, this module reads in incoming queries and verifies that there are no mistakes before retrieving results from the index.


Operation:-
With options for seed URLs and crawl restrictions, the crawler may be started from the command line. After processing the crawled data, the indexer saves the indices in a pickle file. As it receives query requests, the Flask server processes them and returns responses depending on the data that has been indexed.so by using the command line code we can able to operate this .

Conclusion:-
The project effectively achieved its main goals, producing a useful information retrieval system with effective data management and search capabilities. Increasing crawler efficiency and guaranteeing indexing accuracy were challenges. Future developments could involve strengthening the AI components to increase query context comprehension

Data Sources:-
Data was primarily sourced from publicly accessible web documents, with links and access details maintained in an internal repository for compliance with data use agreements.

Test Cases:-
Robustness and fault tolerance were ensured by conducting extensive testing covering the crawler, indexer, and query processor's many functionality. High coverage percentages across modules were achieved by using test frameworks such as pytest.

Source Code:-
The source code is organized for ease of maintenance and scalability, follows best practices, and is thoroughly documented. It depends on a number of open-source libraries, which are described in the documentation, and has extensive comments.

Bibliography:-
The project references were formatted according to the Chicago style, citing recent studies and articles in information retrieval, machine learning, and web crawling technologies. Notable references include works from journals and conferences like ACM/IEEE on Information Retrieval and the application of machine learning techniques in text processing.
